    I'm a computer scientist working on Machine Learning.
    I'm doing a cool new thing that is secret for now but soon won't be.
    Before that, I was a research scientist at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain">Google Brain</a>.
  </p>

	<p>
    A lot of my work has been on Program Synthesis -- in which we try to get computers to program themselves.
    I led Brain's work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732">Program Synthesis with Large Language Models</a>,
     co-created Google Sheet's <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/10/smart-fill-google-sheets-automate-data-entry.html">SmartFill Program Synthesizer</a>,
     and jointly invented the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00114">Scratchpad Technique</a> for getting 
     Transformers to perform multi-step reasoning.
  </p>

    Before that, I worked on Image Synthesis -- in which we try to get computers to make pretty pictures :)
    Along with collaborators, I did a lot of the early work on scaling up 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>.
    That includes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09585">the first GAN to generate real ImageNet samples</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318">the paper that made Self-Attention work in GANs</a>, and 
    <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/">work that diagnosed and fixed the frequency artifacts that plagued early synthesis models</a>.
    Techniques from these papers are currently used in production graphics systems at multiple large technology companies.
  </p>
    
	<p>
    I have also worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09170">Semi-Supervised Learning</a>
    and other, miscellaneous topics, such as 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10875">Coverage-Guided Fuzzing of Neural Networks</a>.
  </p>

	<p>
    I came to Brain by being in the first batch of <a href="https://ai.google/research/join-us/ai-residency/">Google Brain Residents</a>, 
    before which I worked at a startup called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervana_Systems">Nervana Systems</a>.
    Before all of that, I was a trader: I worked at <a href="https://fiverings.com/">this proprietary trading firm</a>
    and <a href="https://www.mlp.com/home/">this hedge fund</a>.
    Before I was a trader, I was a Math major at
    <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>.
